 Allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete product details. It provides functionalities like
adding product details, generating inventory reports, updating product quantity, and removing products
from the inventory.

* * * Supplier Management System * * *
 Enables users to manage supplier details such as adding new suppliers, retrieving supplier details,
updating supplier information, generating supplier reports, and deleting suppliers from the system.
